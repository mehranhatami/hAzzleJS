 * Compatibility
 *
 * This module picks the best functions for each individual browser
 *
 * TODO!!
 *
 *  Find the differences and create the best function for each browsers. Then in top of the Core file we do:
 *
 *  var substring = Compatibility['Chrome'][substr] || prototype.substring
 *
 * We then first need to find current browser. All this will make sure each browser have the same performance
